##1 : In Java, strings are immutable, which means that once a string object is created, its value cannot be changed.
      The concat() method creates a new string by appending the specified string to the end of the original string, but
      it does not modify the original string. In this case, the concatenated string is not being assigned to s1, so when
      you print s1, it still holds the original value of "Durga". If you want to print "Durga Software", you need to
      assign the concatenated string to s1 like this:
              String s1 = "Durga";
              s1 = s1.concat("Software");
              System.out.println(s1);
